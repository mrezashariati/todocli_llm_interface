    "### To Do:\n",
    "- implement scenarios. start from simple single step and continue with more complex:\n",
    "    - adding task (1 step)\n",
    "    - listing tasks (1 step)\n",
    "    - moving tasks to new context (1 step)\n",
    "    - modifying task attributes (1 step)\n",
    "    - removing context (1 step)\n",
    "    - removing task (2 steps)\n",
    "    - merging contexts (2 steps)\n",
    "    - adding deadline, start, period or any sort of time (2 step)\n",
    "    - mark task as done (2 steps)\n",
    "- json won't parse if a character is extra or missing. make it robust.\n",
    "- read some blog posts about the same software solutions\n",
    "- connect function calling with llm and test a few basic scenarios\n",
    "- enhance prompt:\n",
    "    - tune tempereture. Start with 0 temperature\n",
    "- Frontend: use streamlit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helper functions\n",
    "- find a task by name -> get_task_id(task_name) returns success ? task_id : None\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    "- spell checking. may need to first find the correct task title and id.\n",
    "- may be good to store the last n characters of the conversation and input it as context to the model.\n",
    "- best way for remote function calling in python\n",
    "- model may perform repetitive operations. when asked to merge, it added some tasks first which is wrong.\n",
    "- can pass history in each request to enrich the propmt.\n",
    "- can pass the output of todo --flat in each request to enrich the promp.\n",
    "- can let the model hallucinate to see other scenarios and test cases and the model's response\n",
    "- can specify the steps the model needs to take to respond for each specific query and command\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "- design a feedback loop. how the model is meant to know the meaning of errors?"
