\section{Portfolio documentation}
\label{sec:documentation}

Compile a comprehensive documentation of your project, including the design, implementation and testing, detailing the integration of RAG capabilities, the challenges encountered, solutions developed, and the impact of these features on the system's functionality. 
Briefly document the process for integrating external data sources, like calendars, weather APIs, or web search services. This does not include handling API keys, managing rate limits, and ensuring data privacy and security! Keep it simple.

Students write the entire documentation with sections, sub-sections, diagrams, etc in this section. Please write as comprehensively as possible. Head to the document 1\_documentation.tex. You are free to use as many subsections as required. We will not provide a template for documentation.
